# üöÄ GitHub Push Instructions - Force Push Required

## üî¥ Current Situation

The repository cannot be pushed to GitHub because **large files exist in git history**, even though they've been removed from the current commit and added to `.gitignore`.

### Large Files in Git History:
1. **`data/caudales_diarios.csv`** - 128.70 MB (old location)
2. **`data/csv/caudales_diarios.csv`** - 128.70 MB (current location)
3. **`data/eventos_sequia_p5_diario.csv`** - 130.62 MB

### ‚úÖ What's Been Done:
- ‚úÖ Files added to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Files removed from current commit
- ‚úÖ `DATA.md` created with download instructions
- ‚úÖ Local commit created successfully

### ‚ùå The Problem:
GitHub rejects the push because it scans the **entire git history**, not just the current commit. The large files exist in previous commits.

## üí° Solution: Force Push to Overwrite Remote History

Since the large files were already pushed to GitHub in previous commits, you need to **force push** to overwrite the remote history with your cleaned local history.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Force pushing will **rewrite git history** on the remote repository. Only do this if:
- You're the only person working on this repository, OR
- You've coordinated with all collaborators

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: GitHub Desktop (Recommended)

### Steps:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
   - Your repository should be loaded
   - You should see the recent commit: "Fix: Exclude large data file from repository"

2. **Check for Force Push Option**
   - Look for "Force Push" option in the Repository menu
   - OR check if there's a checkbox/option during push

3. **Force Push the Branch**
   - Go to: **Repository** ‚Üí **Push** (or click Push origin)
   - If GitHub Desktop doesn't offer force push, you'll need to use the command line (see Option 2)

### Alternative in GitHub Desktop:
If force push isn't available in the UI:
1. Go to **Repository** ‚Üí **Open in Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. Run: `git push origin main --force`

---

## üíª Option 2: Command Line (Alternative)

### Method A: Force Push (Fastest)

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd /c/Users/39401439R/Desktop/Drought_Dashboard

# Force push to overwrite remote history
git push origin main --force

# Should succeed now!
```

### Method B: Force Push with Lease (Safer)

This checks that no one else has pushed changes since your last pull:

```bash
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

---

## üîß Option 3: Clean History Completely (Most Thorough)

If force push doesn't work or you want to completely remove large files from history, use BFG Repo Cleaner:

### Using BFG Repo Cleaner:

1. **Download BFG**
   - Visit: https://reps-git.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
   - Download `bfg.jar`

2. **Run BFG to remove large files**
   ```bash
   # Remove all files larger than 100M from history
   java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M Drought_Dashboard

   # Clean up
   cd Drought_Dashboard
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

3. **Force push cleaned repository**
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

## ‚úÖ Verification After Successful Push

Once your push succeeds, verify on GitHub:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/AlexCrespilloLopez/Drought_Dashboard

2. **Check Files**:
   - ‚úÖ `.gitignore` is present
   - ‚úÖ `DATA.md` is visible with download instructions
   - ‚úÖ `FIX_LARGE_FILE.md` is visible
   - ‚úÖ `data/csv/eventos_sequia_p5.csv` (small file, 176KB) IS included
   - ‚úÖ `data/csv/caudales_diarios.csv` (large file, 131MB) is NOT included
   - ‚úÖ `data/eventos_sequia_p5_diario.csv` is NOT included

3. **Check Repository Size**:
   - Should be significantly smaller (< 50MB total)
   - Can see size at bottom of GitHub repo page

## üîÑ What Happens Next?

### For You (Repository Owner):
- ‚úÖ Your local files remain untouched
- ‚úÖ Large files stay on your computer for analysis
- ‚úÖ Git won't track them anymore (they're in `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Future pushes will be much faster

### For Future Clones:
- ‚úÖ Anyone cloning the repo gets a clean, small repository
- ‚úÖ They see `DATA.md` with instructions to download large files
- ‚úÖ They contact you (acrespillo@ipe.csic.es) to obtain the data

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "Updates were rejected"
**Solution**: Use `--force` flag (you're the repo owner, this is safe)

### Error: "GH001: Large files detected"
**Solution**: You need to completely remove files from history using BFG (Option 3)

### Error: "Repository locked"
**Solution**: Contact GitHub support, they may have locked the repo due to large file size

### Push Takes Very Long
**Solution**: Normal if repo has large history. Wait for completion.

## üìä Summary

| Action | Status | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Remove files from current commit | ‚úÖ Done | `git rm --cached` |
| Add files to `.gitignore` | ‚úÖ Done | Updated `.gitignore` |
| Create documentation | ‚úÖ Done | `DATA.md`, `FIX_LARGE_FILE.md` |
| Force push to GitHub | ‚è≥ **Next Step** | **Use GitHub Desktop or command line** |

---

## üéØ Recommended Action

**For fastest resolution**: Use **Option 1** (GitHub Desktop) or **Option 2 Method A** (command line force push)

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

This will overwrite the remote history with your cleaned local history.
